The competition covers rigorous static and dynamic tests. Static tests include the team's business plan presentation, car production cost analysis and technical design evaluation. Dynamic tests assess the car's performance on the track, covering challenges such as skidpad, acceleration, autocross, endurance and efficiency. The scores obtained in these tests contribute to the calculation of the teams' overall score, thus determining the winners of each category.",
